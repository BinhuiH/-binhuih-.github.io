      <p>1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</p>
        I tried each block and found that they all had different functions. 
        The first one was just about his name; the second block was a moving picture 
          that repeated twice and intersected and then separated and I tried to click on it 
          but it didn't seem to be interactive; the third block was about the process and the idea of the class 
          and I found it interesting. Then the fourth block had some interesting other pages that were also interactive; 
          the fifth block had some buttons I spent some time making them all ticked; the sixth block had some contact 
          information for the author; and in the seventh block I clicked in to read some of his blogs. What I thought 
          was amazing was the eighth block, when I swiped the button I found that it could change the shape of all the 
          blocks from square to oval. Finally, I clicked on all the close buttons and found that they could be closed, 
          so I ended up with just a border and the rest was blank.</p><br>
          <p>2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>
          The first thing I paid attention to was the image block, which I found to be complementary.</p><br>
          <p>3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>
          The experience I spent the most time engaging with was watching 
            the author's blog and trying out the models he put on the page.</p><br>
            <p>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
             My most common action in my two minute interaction with the experience was clicking</p><br>
            <p>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>
            I think the intended primary goal of the interactive experience was to popularize science, and he 
              completed the page by setting up different areas for users to experience, which I think is a kind of ]
              science about interactive</p><br>
              <p>6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</p>
              A kind of personal introduction page.</p><br>
              <p>7) What is your impression of the intended length of a 
                single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</p>
                Because I'm a fast-paced kind of person, I don't really need that kind of slow
                   pace with a lot of waiting, I prefer the fast and direct way.

        <h1>Week3</h1>
        <p>8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</p>
           He uses more interactive methods than the usual web pages to make the user feel involved and to 
            control the page more like an application than a web page. He uses a motion picture to represent
             the self-sufficiency of this section, which is a section that can be supplemented.</p><br>
             <p>9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</p>
             I think he has a lot of interactive blocks which is something that can add to the user experience and
               get them engaged in the page rather than browsing.</p><br>
               <p>10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</p>
               It's the second block with the moving image part, because I thought I could interact with it as well as the other parts.</p><br>
               <p>11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</p>
                Regarding the block that controls the whole page, I think it's very cool that it's not just interactive but controllable.</p>
